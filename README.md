Code snapshot for the EMNLP 2021 paper `Boosting Cross-Lingual Transfer viaSelf-Learning with Uncertainty Estimation`.

This repository contains two directories; each directory is an independent project as follows:

* ner: code for the NER task.

* nli: code for the NLI task.

Dataset preprocessing and evaluation for both tasks follow [XTREME](https://github.com/google-research/xtreme). Configurations are defined in the `experiments.conf` for each project.
